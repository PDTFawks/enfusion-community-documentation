Click “+Create” Then click “folder” Name the folder “scripts”. Click on the “scripts” folder you made. Repeat steps 2-5 changing “scripts” to the correct folder name. Finally we need to create a “Modded” folder for our script to go in. 7.1 This keeps everything nice and tidy and ensures there’s no confusion between the original and ours.  When you’re done it should look like this: Now create a script file (“+Create” \u0026gt; “Script”) and name it “SCR_GameCoreBase”. The reason we name it the same is: so that we know exactly what we are changing. And so 6 months down the road, we aren’t looking through 20 different files trying to figure out where we changed it, we can find it.\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/enfusion-community-documentation/Scripting/Tutorials/1.-Hello-World/2.-Creation/","title":"2.

Every time you save your code you will need to recompile it. Every. Time. Remember how in Arma 3 there was a debug console? Yeah..that’s gone.\nKnow how I said paths are important, well here’s the vanilla paths: The paths in parens “()” are what you need to recreate in your project folder.\nAlright, enough of the boring stuff, let’s write “Hello World”. For this example we will be writing a bit of code that will print “Hello World” when you start a scenario.\nThis tutorial is based off of the official “Scripting Modding” documentation.
