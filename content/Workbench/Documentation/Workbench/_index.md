The workbench is the hub for all Enfusion tools. It is where your file tree is located and where you access the various tools from.

<span style="color:red">Toolbar. Here you can access different editors, change settings, etc.</span>\
<span style="color:green">Resource Browser. Here is where you view/create files. You’ll use this quite a bit.</span>\
<span style="color:purple">File viewer. If you double click on a file in the “Resource Browser” it will be previewed here. The exception being any file that has a specific editor association will open that editor.</span>\
<span style="color:yellow">Log console. Here you’ll see any Workbench errors.</span>\
<span style="color:teal">Resource Variants. I don’t know what this is for at the moment.</span>\
