Compile note: If you compile while in the “World Editor” it will restart the “World Editor”..
{{< /hint >}}


Now we need to open the World Editor. To do this switch to the Workbench then press ```“Editors” > “World Editor”```.

In the World Editor we need to load the Eden world. To do this go ```“File” > “Load World” or press CTRL + O. Then double click on “Eden.ent”```.

Once Eden loads press the green play button on the top bar and let it load. Once it loads, switch to the “Script Editor” and look in the “Output Box”. You should see “Hello World” (say “hello” back!). It should look like this:


##### Congratulations! You’ve just created your first script and made it execute when a scenario loads!
