A good first script to get you started.

Alright, before we get into how to say “Hello World” and such we need to go over some quirks:
* Paths are important; your code will not run if it isn’t in the correct path.
* Every time you save your code you will need to recompile it. Every. Time.
* Remember how in Arma 3 there was a debug console? Yeah..that’s gone.

Know how I said paths are important, well here’s the vanilla paths:
|Project      | Path                          |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
|Engine       |('scripts/Core')               |
|GameLib      |('scripts/GameLib')            |
|Game         |('scripts/Game')               |
|Entities     |                               |
|WorkbenchGame|('scripts/WorkbenchGameCommon')|
|Workbench    |('scripts/WorkbenchCommon')    |
The paths in parens “()” are what you need to recreate in your project folder.

Alright, enough of the boring stuff, let’s write “Hello World”. For this example we will be writing a bit of code that will print “Hello World” when you start a scenario.

This tutorial is based off of the official “Scripting Modding” documentation. I recommend reading through it.
